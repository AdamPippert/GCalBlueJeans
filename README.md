# GCalBlueJeans
Set up BlueJeans meeting credentials automatically when adding meetings to a Google Calendar

Plan is to use Google Apps Scripting to inject meeting invites with Blue Jeans meeting room info
Perhaps extending to automatically add attendees by forwarding meeting agenda to myself with a subject tag
